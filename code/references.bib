  abstract = {Bacteria acquire novel DNA through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), a process that enables an organism to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions, provides a competitive edge and potentially alters its relationship with its host. Although the HGT process is routinely exploited in laboratories, there is a surprising disconnect between what we know from laboratory experiments and what we know from natural environments, such as the human gut microbiome. Owing to a suite of newly available computational algorithms and experimental approaches, we have a broader understanding of the genes that are being transferred and are starting to understand the ecology of HGT in natural microbial communities. This Review focuses on these new technologies, the questions they can address and their limitations. As these methods are applied more broadly, we are beginning to recognize the full extent of HGT possible within a microbiome and the punctuated dynamics of HGT, specifically in response to external stimuli. Furthermore, we are better characterizing the complex selective pressures on mobile genetic elements and the mechanisms by which they interact with the bacterial host genome.},

  abstract = {Fishes living in icy seawater are usually protected from freezing by endogenous antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that bind to ice crystals and stop them from growing. The scattered distribution of five highly diverse AFP types across phylogenetically disparate fish species is puzzling. The appearance of radically different AFPs in closely related species has been attributed to the rapid, independent evolution of these proteins in response to natural selection caused by sea level glaciations within the last 20 million years. In at least one instance the same type of simple repetitive AFP has independently originated in two distant species by convergent evolution. But, the isolated occurrence of three very similar type II AFPs in three distantly related species (herring, smelt and sea raven) cannot be explained by this mechanism. These globular, lectin-like AFPs have a unique disulfide-bonding pattern, and share up to 85\% identity in their amino acid sequences, with regions of even higher identity in their genes. A thorough search of current databases failed to find a homolog in any other species with greater than 40\% amino acid sequence identity. Consistent with this result, genomic Southern blots showed the lectin-like AFP gene was absent from all other fish species tested. The remarkable conservation of both intron and exon sequences, the lack of correlation between evolutionary distance and mutation rate, and the pattern of silent vs non-silent codon changes make it unlikely that the gene for this AFP pre-existed but was lost from most branches of the teleost radiation. We propose instead that lateral gene transfer has resulted in the occurrence of the type II AFPs in herring, smelt and sea raven and allowed these species to survive in an otherwise lethal niche.},

  abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT; also known as lateral gene transfer) is the non-sexual movement of genetic information between genomes. Incoming DNA or RNA can replace existing genes, or can introduce new genes into a genome.HGT in eukaryotes has been overshadowed by its prevalence in bacterial genomes, but a large number of cases involving eukaryotes have nevertheless been described. Its impact is variable from lineage to lineage, and many of the lineages that are most affected by HGT are the least studied at the genomic level (for example, protists), so the importance of HGT will probably increase as databases expand.There is an extensive history of endosymbiosis in eukaryotic evolution. Endosymbiosis-derived organelles like mitochondria and plastids contributed many genes to the nucleus, and subsequent endosymbioses in plastid evolution has also allowed genes to move between eukaryotes. Other persistent endosymbionts (for example, Wolbachia) have now been recognized as a major source of DNA in the nuclei of their hosts.HGT without symbiosis is also common, most documented cases involve genes from bacteria being present in the nucleus. Their prevalence might be because they are more obvious than genes from another eukaryote, but bacteria might be the major source of new genes owing to their abundance.The complex distribution of some previously 'simple' bacteria\textendash eukaryote transfers suggests eukaryote\textendash eukaryote transfers might be more common than is appreciated. Extensive exchange of genetic information between mitochondrial genomes of plants is now well documented, providing the highest known levels of eukaryote\textendash eukaryote transfer.In many instances, genes acquired by HGT have clear functional or ecological implications for their new host. For example, several highly derived anaerobes have acquired many metabolic genes from bacteria that probably contributed to their adaptation to anaerobic environments.Although the confounding effect of HGT on phylogenetic reconstruction is well known, ancient HGT events have been recognized as useful clues to organismal relationships. Several ancient HGT events are shared by two or more major eukaryotic lineages, such as animals and fungi, or chromalveolates, and such shared characters (interpreted with caution) help understand the tree of eukaryotes.Recent transfers are observed more often than ancient ones. This might be a sampling bias, but could indicate that transferred genes provide a transient advantage but are frequently not retained over prolonged periods of time. If so, the impact of HGT in the long term might not be so profound.Even with the growth of genomic data, several questions remain challenging: the fate of transferred genes over time, the mechanisms of HGT, and what dictates the impact of HGT on different lineages are all major outstanding questions. On the basis of the history of HGT research in bacteria, it seems likely that many questions that seem simple now will become more complex as data accumulates.},

In microbes, lateral gene transfer is the dominant process that spoils strictly tree-like phylogenies, but in multicellular eukaryotes hybridization and introgression among related species is probably more important. Because many species, including the ancestors of ancient major lineages, seem to evolve rapidly in adaptive radiations, some sexual compatibility may exist among them. Introgression and reticulation can thereby affect all parts of the tree of life, not just the recent species at the tips. Our understanding of adaptive evolution, speciation, phylogenetics, and comparative biology must adapt to these mostly recent findings. Introgression has important practical implications as well, not least for the management of genetically modified organisms in pest and disease control.},

  abstract = {It has been reported that the number of transcription factors encoded in prokaryotic genomes scales approximately quadratically with their total number of genes. We propose a conceptual explanation of this finding and illustrate it using a simple model in which metabolic and regulatory networks of prokaryotes are shaped by horizontal gene transfer of coregulated metabolic pathways. Adapting to a new environmental condition monitored by a new transcription factor (e.g., learning to use another nutrient) involves both acquiring new enzymes and reusing some of the enzymes already encoded in the genome. As the repertoire of enzymes of an organism (its toolbox) grows larger, it can reuse its enzyme tools more often and thus needs to get fewer new ones to master each new task. From this observation, it logically follows that the number of functional tasks and their regulators increases faster than linearly with the total number of genes encoding enzymes. Genomes can also shrink, e.g., because of a loss of a nutrient from the environment, followed by deletion of its regulator and all enzymes that become redundant. We propose several simple models of network evolution elaborating on this toolbox argument and reproducing the empirically observed quadratic scaling. The distribution of lengths of pathway branches in our model agrees with that of the real-life metabolic network of Escherichia coli. Thus, our model provides a qualitative explanation for broad distributions of regulon sizes in prokaryotes.},

Motivated by the challenge of diversity and the need to forge ways of capturing dynamical behaviour connecting genes to function, biologically independent experimental communities comprising hundreds of microbial genera were established from garden compost and propagated on nitrogen-limited minimal medium with cellulose (paper) as sole carbon source. After 1 year of bi-weekly transfer, communities retained hundreds of genera. To connect genes to function, we used a simple experimental manipulation that involved the periodic collection of selfish genetic elements (SGEs) from separate communities, followed by pooling and redistribution across communities. The treatment was predicted to promote amplification and dissemination of SGEs and thus horizontal gene transfer. Confirmation came from comparative metagenomics, which showed the substantive movement of ecologically significant genes whose dynamic across space and time could be followed. Enrichment of genes implicated in nitrogen metabolism, and particularly ammonification, prompted biochemical assays that revealed a measurable impact on community function. Our simple experimental strategy offers a conceptually new approach for unravelling dynamical processes affecting microbial community function., This article is part of the theme issue `Conceptual challenges in microbial community ecology'.},

These dependences are gene class specific but hold across the entire diversity of bacteria and archaea. Several models have been proposed to explain these universal scaling laws, primarily based on the specifics of the respective biological functions. However, a population-genetic theory of universal scaling is lacking. We employ a simple mathematical model for prokaryotic genome evolution, which, together with the analysis of 34 clusters of closely related bacterial genomes, allows us to identify the underlying factors that govern the evolution of the genome content. Evolution of the gene content is dominated by two functional class-specific parameters: selection coefficient and genome plasticity. The selection coefficient quantifies the fitness cost associated with deletion of a gene in a given functional class or the advantage of successful incorporation of an additional gene. Genome plasticity reflects both the availability of the genes of a given class in the external gene pool that is accessible to the evolving population and the ability of microbes to accommodate these genes in the short term, that is, the class-specific horizontal gene transfer barrier. The selection coefficient determines the gene loss rate, whereas genome plasticity is the principal determinant of the gene gain rate.}

  abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important role in bacterial evolution. It is well accepted that DNA is pulled/pushed into recipient cells by conserved membrane-associated DNA transport systems, which allow the entry of only single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). However, recent studies have uncovered a new type of natural bacterial transformation in which double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is taken up into the cytoplasm, thus complementing the existing methods of DNA transfer among bacteria. Regulated by the stationary-phase regulators RpoS and cAMP receptor protein (CRP), Escherichia coli establishes competence for natural transformation with dsDNA, which occurs in agar plates. To pass across the outer membrane, a putative channel, which may compete for the substrate with the porin OmpA, may mediate the transfer of exogenous dsDNA into the cell. To pass across the inner membrane, dsDNA may be bound to the periplasmic protein YdcS, which delivers it into the inner membrane channel formed by YdcV. The discovery of cell-to-cell contact-dependent plasmid transformation implies the presence of additional mechanism(s) of transformation. This review will summarize the current knowledge about mechanisms of HGT with an emphasis on recent progresses regarding non-canonical mechanisms of natural transformation. Fully understanding the mechanisms of HGT will provide a foundation for monitoring and controlling multidrug resistance.}

  abstract = {Mutation and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) continually give rise to new bacterial genotypes. Infrequently, such new bacterial genotypes establish and spread in the larger population through either positive selection or random genetic drift. Therefore, bacterial genomes are in a constant state of flux, and any segment of DNA in a large bacterial population might have the opportunity to be horizontally transferred.Three main mechanisms of HGT have been described: natural transformation, the uptake of free DNA in competent bacteria, exhibited by about 1\% of validly described bacterial species; transduction, the transfer of bacterial DNA between a bacteriophage-infected bacterium and a bacteriophage-susceptible bacterium; and conjugation, the transfer of mobile genetic elements by pili structures assembled between two adjacently located bacteria.A number of factors limit the transfer, uptake and stabilization of foreign DNA molecules acquired by bacteria. These include limited release and stability of adaptive DNA in the environment; limits on competence development; limits on host range of the transfer and maintenance mechanism of mobile genetic elements; recipient restriction enzyme activity; and limited ability of foreign DNA to integrate into a replicating genetic element owing to a lack of DNA sequence similarity.Homologous recombination depends on the incoming DNA containing regions between 25 and 200 bp in length, depending on the system, of high similarity to the recipient genome. Dependence on DNA sequence similarity for recombination between species is relaxed in some mutator strains. DNA acquisition through double-stranded breaks and end-joining \textemdash{} illegitimate recombination \textemdash{} applies more to integration of circular DNA than linear fragments.Most of the understanding of the processes facilitating HGT and their frequencies of occurrence have come from well designed laboratory studies of a few model bacterial species. These studies have proven suited to resolve the basic biological mechanisms involved, but fail to encompass the environmental variables involved. We have still to develop a quantitative and qualitative understanding of ongoing gene-transfer processes occurring under natural conditions. Biologically significant gene-transfer processes might occur at temporospatial scales that current methodology do not allow us to monitor.},

Here, in the holoparasitic stem parasite Cuscuta, we identify 108 transcribed and probably functional HGT events in Cuscuta campestris and related species, plus 42 additional regions with host-derived transposon, pseudogene and non-coding sequences. Surprisingly, 18 Cuscuta fHGTs were acquired from the same gene families by independent HGT events in Orobanchaceae parasites, and the majority are highly expressed in the haustorial feeding structures in both lineages. Convergent retention and expression of HGT sequences suggests an adaptive role for specific additional genes in parasite biology. Between 16 and 20 of the transcribed HGT events are inferred as ancestral in Cuscuta based on transcriptome sequences from species across the phylogenetic range of the genus, implicating fHGT in the successful radiation of Cuscuta parasites. Genome sequencing of C. campestris supports transfer of genomic DNA\textemdash rather than retroprocessed RNA\textemdash as the mechanism of fHGT. Many of the C. campestris genes horizontally acquired are also frequent sources of 24-nucleotide small RNAs that are typically associated with RNA-directed DNA methylation. One HGT encoding a leucine-rich repeat protein kinase overlaps with a microRNA that has been shown to regulate host gene expression, suggesting that HGT-derived parasite small RNAs may function in the parasite\textendash host interaction. This study enriches our understanding of HGT by describing a parasite\textendash host system with unprecedented gene exchange that points to convergent evolution of HGT events and the functional importance of horizontally transferred coding and non-coding sequences.},
