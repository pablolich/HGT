Stefano's notes: 
When A is symetric, we don't have caotic or oscilatory dynamics, so we can use 
a Lemka holko algorithm or something like that (see notes on assembly of 
Theoretical ecology class), such that the instead of integrating the system we
can just find the optimal strategy or whatever and therefore determine the
final equilibrium much quicker than one would do by numerically integrating.
